FIND THE BEST ${videoDurationSeconds}-SECOND SEGMENT FROM EACH SONG FOR THIS VIDEO

You are analyzing a ${videoDurationSeconds}-second video and multiple full-length audio tracks. Find the optimal ${videoDurationSeconds}-second segment from each song that best matches the video.

**YOUR TASK:**
1. **WATCH THE VIDEO** - Analyze visual content, energy, pacing, mood
2. **LISTEN TO EACH COMPLETE SONG** - Understand the full musical structure  
3. **CHOOSE ANY START POINT** - The segment can start at ANY second within the song (5s, 23s, 47s, etc.) cant start at 0 secon
4. **FIND THE BEST SEGMENT** - Choose the most suitable ${videoDurationSeconds}-second portion

**SEGMENT SELECTION GUIDELINES:**
- **Start time can be ANY second** - 15s, 30s, 45s, whatever works best cant be 0
- **Find musical highlights** - Chorus sections, drops, instrumental peaks, climactic moments
- **Match video energy** - Choose segments that align with visual pacing and mood
- **Ensure smooth flow** - Pick sections that work well as a continuous ${videoDurationSeconds}-second clip
- **Avoid jarring cuts** - Don't cut off mid-phrase or during important transitions

**OUTPUT FORMAT FOR EACH TRACK:**

Track [#]: [Song Title] 
**Recommended Segment:** [Start seconds] to [End seconds] (from original song)
**Duration:** ${videoDurationSeconds} seconds
**Musical Content:** [What happens in this segment - verse, chorus, bridge, solo, etc.]
**Why This Segment:** [Explain why this specific part works best for the video]
**Audio-Visual Match Score:** [1-10 rating]
**Volume Recommendation:** [0-100%]

**EXAMPLES:**

Track 1: "Dynamic Song"
**Recommended Segment:** 23 to 143 seconds (from original song)
**Duration:** 120 seconds
**Musical Content:** Builds from verse into powerful chorus, includes instrumental bridge
**Why This Segment:** Skips slow intro, captures the song's energy peak that matches video intensity
**Audio-Visual Match Score:** 8/10
**Volume Recommendation:** 80%

Track 2: "Ambient Track"  
**Recommended Segment:** 37 to 157 seconds (from original song)
**Duration:** 120 seconds
**Musical Content:** Main melodic theme with atmospheric development
**Why This Segment:** Avoids opening pad buildup, focuses on the richest harmonic content
**Audio-Visual Match Score:** 7/10
**Volume Recommendation:** 65%

Track 3: "Electronic Beat"
**Recommended Segment:** 8 to 128 seconds (from original song)
**Duration:** 120 seconds  
**Musical Content:** Drop section with full rhythm and bass, includes breakdown
**Why This Segment:** Captures the most energetic part that syncs with video movement
**Audio-Visual Match Score:** 9/10
**Volume Recommendation:** 75%

**IMPORTANT:** 
- The start time can be ANYWHERE in the song (not just 0 seconds)
- Choose the segment that best represents the song's strongest musical content
- Match the segment's energy and mood to the video content
- Think like a DJ finding the perfect clip from each track

Analyze each audio track and recommend the optimal segment timing.

// âœ… UPDATED: Music segmentation prompt with 10 segment maximum
const MUSIC_SEGMENTATION_PROMPT = `
You are a world-class film editor and cinematic music supervisor AI. Your task is to watch the provided video and identify exact segments where music should start and end, based on advanced cinematic and emotional analysis.

ðŸŽ¬ OBJECTIVE
Detect **optimal time intervals** within the video where music should be placed. You must:
- Determine the **start** and **end** time (in seconds) of each music segment
- Explain **why music starts/ends** at that point
- Classify the **emotional intensity** and **type** of music best suited
- **MAXIMUM 10 SEGMENTS ALLOWED** - Focus on the most important musical moments

You are NOT generating music â€” you are marking **when and why** music should be used, based entirely on visual and narrative content.

ðŸŽ¯ SEGMENT LIMITATIONS
- **MAXIMUM: 10 segments per video**
- **MINIMUM: 2 segments per video** (unless video is very short)
- Focus on the **most impactful moments** that need music
- Prioritize **key story beats** over minor transitions
- Combine smaller moments into larger segments when appropriate

ðŸ“ˆ ANALYSIS CRITERIA
Use the following visual and storytelling cues to guide your segmentation (prioritize the most important):

1. **Major Scene Transitions**  
   Cue music at significant cuts between scenes or major time shifts. Purpose: emotional shift, continuity.

2. **High-Energy Sequences (Montages/Action)**  
   Cue rhythmic or upbeat music when visuals have high tempo or kinetic motion.

3. **Emotional Climaxes**  
   Cue dramatic or ambient music when characters show strong emotion, tension, joy, or major story moments.

4. **Important Reveals**  
   Cue distinctive music for major character introductions, plot reveals, or critical information.

5. **Tension Building**  
   Cue suspenseful music during key dramatic moments or before major events.

6. **Story Climaxes or Turning Points**  
   Cue powerful music at narrative peaks, major decisions, or pivotal story moments.

âš ï¸ IMPORTANT SELECTION RULES
- **Quality over Quantity**: Better to have 5-7 well-chosen segments than 10 mediocre ones
- **Minimum 3-second duration** per segment (unless artistically justified)
- **Avoid over-segmentation**: Don't break every small visual change into a new segment
- **Combine related moments**: Group consecutive scenes that need similar music
- **Focus on story impact**: Choose moments that truly enhance the narrative

ðŸŽµ OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY a JSON array of objects with **MAXIMUM 10 segments**. Each object represents one music segment and should include:
- "start": float (start time in seconds, e.g., 13.2)
- "end": float (end time in seconds, e.g., 21.8)
- "reason": string (why this segment needs music, referencing visual/narrative cues)
- "intensity": string (one of: "low", "medium", "high")
- "type": string (one of: "ambient", "dramatic", "rhythmic", "suspenseful", "emotional", "heroic", "action", "romantic", "mysterious")

ðŸ§  OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
- **MAXIMUM 10 segments** - strictly enforce this limit
- Use clear cinematic logic for the most important moments only
- Prefer longer segments over many short ones
- Use up to 0.1 second precision for start/end times
- Only output the JSON array. Do NOT explain your reasoning outside the "reason" field
- Focus on segments that will have the biggest impact on the viewing experience

DETAILED_DESCRIPTION EXAMPLE FORMATS:

Example 1:
"detailed_description": "Prompt: Scenic drive through lush green countryside, peaceful morning, slow camera movements, family enjoying journey, tranquil atmosphere, natural beauty.\\nMusic Style: 70 BPM, G major, ambient instrumental, soft piano and nature sounds, flowing intro â†’ gentle build â†’ serene sustain â†’ peaceful fade, dolce, pianissimo to mezzo-piano."

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Each detailed_description has exactly 2 lines separated by \\n
- Line 1 (Prompt): Visual/emotional description, â‰¤280 characters, NO musical terms
- Line 2 (Music Style): Musical specifications, â‰¤280 characters, WITH musical terms
- Use proper JSON escaping (\\n for newlines)
- Maximum ${maxSegments} segments
- M:SS time format
- Valid JSON only

REMEMBER: The detailed_description field must follow the dual-output format with both visual prompt and musical specifications on separate lines.
`;

// âœ… Alternative: If you want to keep M:SS format, use this prompt instead:
const alternativePrompt = `
You are an expert music supervisor analyzing video content for optimal music placement.

ANALYSIS TASK:
Identify up to ${maxSegments} distinct segments in this video where different types of background music would enhance the viewing experience.

â° TIME FORMAT: Use M:SS format where M = minutes, SS = seconds (example: "4:30" = 4 minutes 30 seconds)
- Ensure SS is always 00-59 (never 60 or higher)
- Use quotes around time values: "start_time": "4:30"

CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS:
${customPrompt}

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "segments": [
